    <h2 class="text-dark">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") applies to the personal information that Colab processes in connection with Colab apps, websites,
        software, and related services (the "Services"), that link to or reference this Privacy Policy. The Services enable you to create and interact with
        others through secure messaging.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data Controller: The Services are provided and controlled by Colab Technologies Inc., with its registered address in Cancun, MX
        ("we" or "us"). If you have any questions about how we use your personal data, please contact us <a href="form.html" class="text-decoration-none" style="color: var(--brand-color);">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please be informed that the processing rules for personal information collected from end users when accessing downstream systems or applications
        developed by developers using our open platform services are not covered by this privacy policy. The developer operating the application, as the
        controller of the personal information processing activity, should disclose the relevant personal information protection policies to the end users.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-dark">What Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We collect your information in three ways: Information You Provide, Automatically Collected Information, and Information From Other Sources. More
        detail is provided below.
    </p>

            to protect your account by detecting unusual login activity.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Cookies & Similar Technologies.</strong> We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to operate and provide the Service. For example, we use

        <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Message Information.</strong> While the content of your messages is encrypted end-to-end and cannot be read by us, we collect metadata about your messaging activity such as message delivery status, timestamps, and interaction with messages (read receipts) to provide service functionality.
        </li>
    </ul>
